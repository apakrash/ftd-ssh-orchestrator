# Troubeshooting/FAQ

1. The script is not doing anything, the code seems stuck

make sure that the following is edited in the code for the cluster that you are testing with in ssh-cluster.py
```
my_device = {
"ip": "10.0.0.1",
"username": "admin",
"password": "C1sco12345"
}
```
2. Still not working, what else can I check

Try to ssh to the cluster ip using the credentials defined above, see if the clish prompt opens.

3. How to verify the history/result of past attempts of running the code.

In the same folder there is a log file called app.log, please check that or checking the exact output being recorded:

```
tail -f app.log
```
